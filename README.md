# Local PDF Splitter and Converter

## Description
Local PDF Splitter and Converter is a Python-based tool that I developed to allow users to split PDF documents into individual pages and convert them into PNG format. Designed with privacy and ease of use in mind, this tool processes all documents locally on your device, ensuring that your sensitive information remains private.
